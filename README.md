This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Description
For this project I am creating a copy of the Udacity website. I will be using Angular and Firebase.

## Objectives:

* Well-separated components
* A working database
* Live deployment

**Part 1:**
*  Build out the basic structure of application and separate the code into working components.


**Part 2:**
* Components are used to create display and behavior for templates.
* A router is used to navigate between different pages, including at least one dynamic route.
* A service shares data between multiple components.
* Application can create, edit, and delete instances of a model, persisting all changes in Firebase.
* Data is retrieved from Firebase and displayed in the application.
* Models can be filtered using a custom pipe.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Optional: Application has been deployed.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
#### Prerequisites
#### Clone
  * Clone this repo to your local machine from: https://github.com/adrianmess/site-rebuild
        $ git clone https://github.com/adrianmess/site-rebuild

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Build and Install

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
