This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Description
For this project I am creating a copy of the Udacity website. I will be using Angular and Firebase.

## Objectives:
* Components are used to create display and behavior for templates.
* A router is used to navigate between different pages, including at least one dynamic route.
* A service shares data between multiple components.
* Application can create, edit, and delete instances of a model, persisting all changes in Firebase.
* Data is retrieved from Firebase and displayed in the application.
* Models can be filtered using a custom pipe.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Optional: Application has been deployed.
