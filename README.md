## Description
For this project I am creating a copy of the Udacity website. I will be using Angular and Firebase.
  * Firebase will be used to Create, Read, Update & delete the Nano cards listed.

## Objectives:

* Well-separated components
* A working database
* Live deployment

**Part 1:**
*  Build out the basic structure of application and separate the code into working components.


**Part 2:**
* Components are used to create display and behavior for templates.
* A router is used to navigate between different pages, including at least one dynamic route.
* A service shares data between multiple components.
* Application can create, edit, and delete instances of a model, persisting all changes in Firebase.
* Data is retrieved from Firebase and displayed in the application.
* Models can be filtered using a custom pipe.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Optional: Application has been deployed.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
#### Pre-requisites

### NPM & Node Installation
* Install Node.js
  * https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

* Install TypeScript

      $ npm install -g typescript

* Install Angularcli

      $ npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.5

### Clone
  * Clone this repo to your local machine from: https://github.com/adrianmess/site-rebuild

        $ git clone https://github.com/adrianmess/site-rebuild

#### Firebase API Key
  You'll need to get a Firebase API key information from a project within your firebase account.

  To setup a firebase account follow the steps below

  1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), login with your Google Account, then click on <b>Create New Project</b>.
  2. Enter project name and agree to terms.
  3. Click <b>Create Project</b>
  4. Click <b>Continue</b> to go to project.
  5. Click on Add Firebase to your Web App, a Popup will be shown:
  6. Provide a name and click Register App

Your API Key information will be listed.

Create the file `api-keys.ts` within the `src/app/` directory located in your angular project folder.

Copy the appropriate API Key information into the api-keys.ts file. Then save the file.

Example:

    src/app/api-keys.ts

    export var masterFirebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "[Your API Key goes here]",
      authDomain: "your-project-site.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://your-project-site.firebaseio.com",
      projectId: "your-project-site",
      storageBucket: "",
      messagingSenderId: "messagingSenderId"
    };

Open **Udacity-site-rebuild** folder from terminal.

### NPM Installation
      $ npm install

## Start Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

* The following command will start the server and automatically open the browser.
      $ng serve --open
